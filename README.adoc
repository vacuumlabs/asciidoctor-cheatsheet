// COMMENTS
// Every line that starts with // in asciidoc is a comment. It's like a little
// note you make for yourself that's never printed in the final document. We
// will use comments in this cheatsheet to explain how and why things work.

// SETTINGS
// Asciidoctor gives us multiple settings to customize the look and feel of the
// produced documents. In vacuum handbook, these are taken care of by including
// `header.adoc` file. That means, you usually don't need to care about them at
// all. Below we're going to provide some set of basic settings that worked well
// for us.
//
// Table of contents. We want it displayed on the left with 3 levels of depth
// at max.

= Asciidoctor Cheatsheet
VacuumLabs Folks <hello@vacuumlabs.com>

This cheatsheet was created to help you write or edit your own `.adoc` files.
Before you start, download some
https://we.vacuumlabs.com/vacuum-book/#atom[reasonable text editor^] and clone
https://github.com/vacuumlabs/asciidoctor-cheatsheet[this repository^],
so you can see how things render.

// Section, starts with ==
== Basic Formatting
Writing a basic text with Asciidoctor is similar to what you'd do in Slack. You
can emphasize _important messages with italic_, *even more important ones
with bold*, *_combining them is not recommended_* though. `Monospace is the
right choice if you want to sound like a machine.`

Linebreaks
(enters)
are
ignored in output. So are      too    many   spaces. If you want to start a new
paragraph, leave an empty line.

=== Punctuation marks
[horizontal]
single quotes:: '`irrevocably`'
double quotes:: "`Very nice quote here`"
apostrophes:: Don't worry, they'll work mostly.
irregular appostrophes:: `'60s, Vacuumlabs`' property
m-dash:: Used in sentences--such as this one.
n-dash:: Not supported, you need to enter it yourself 30–50.

=== Links
Links are easy: https://vacuumlabs.com, emails too: hello@vacuumlabs.com. Let's
put some custom text around them: https://vacuumlabs.com[We are the center of excelence],
mailto:hello@vacuumlabs.com[email us now!]

// Section, starts with ==
== Sections
Documents structured into sections are easier to read. Asciidoctor supports
sections, subsections, subsubsections, and so on. The number of `=` indicates
the depth.

// Subsection, starts with ===
[[references]]
=== References
Sometimes its useful to be able to reference other section, such as
<<references>>, or <<references, let's make the references great again!>> Even
paragprahs <<paragraph, can be referenced>>.

[[paragraph]]
All you need to do so is put the name of the reference at its
start.

== Lists
Asciidoctor supports several types of lists. Let's see some examples:

.Steps to enter the office
. Find your entry card.
.. Open your wallet.
.. Look inside.
.. Take the card out.
.. Close the wallet.
. Use it to enter the office.

.Shopping list
* nutella
* banana
* apple
** Red Delicious
** Granny Smith
** Honeycrisp
* Lindt Excellence: A touch of vanilla

.Operating systems
// Only use [horizontal] for short definition lists.
[horizontal]
Windows:: Cheap but broken.
Mac:: Expensive, but works.
Linux:: It doesn't work, but exactly the way you like it.

=== Complex Lists
Sometimes, you may want complex structures as content of your list.

.Most important things in life
* The food.
* The water.
// Following list item contains multiple paragraphs. To indicate their part of
// the same list item, use + instead of the empty line.
* The feeling of appreciation.
+
That feeling you can get only when you're really appreciated.
+
That feeling you can get only when you're really valued.
* The air.

.Extremely complex list
Sometimes, plus is not enough::
Especially when you want to introduce list items that can contain another list
items. It's safer to just wrap them arround:
+
--
Now, anything written here, will be kept together:

.Some other list
The game:: Like this one.
The outcome:: Like that one.

Even

.Some random shopping list
* apple
* banana
* apple-banana pie

You see? It just works.
--
And then you continue::
As you'd anyway.

== Breaking the natural flow

=== Admonitions
NOTE: Admonitions are these nice blocks of content prepended by icon telling you
to beware.

IMPORTANT: Using admonitions may help people realize there's something of
importance going on.

[TIP]
====
You can even include complex multiparagraph content in your admonitions.

Things such as:

* lists
* images
* tables
* or even other admonitions

CAUTION: It might be confusing for your readers if you overdo it.
====

WARNING: Don't overuse them.

=== Quotes
[quote, John F. Kennedy, a long time ago ]
Those who dare to fail miserably can achieve greatly.

=== Sidebars
.The story of great sidebar
****
Once upon a time, there was a man wondering how to tell a story.  This man was
writing a tech manual and story didn't feel like a thing you'd
naturally include.

So he created sidebar, and he put the story in.

=== Custom Embedded Content
You can embed various contents such as Google Maps, YouTube videos, and tons of
others. All you need is `iframe` code, which is usually provided by those sites.

Asciidoctor has a built-in support for YouTube videos, embedding them is even
easier:

== Tables

Asciidoctor can easily make simple tables, with variable column size:

// Simple table with header row and relative column widths specified. The
// outcome should be following:
// |H|HH|HHHH|H| (header row)
// |x|xx|xxxx|x|
// |y|yy|yyyy|y|
// |z|zz|zzzz|z|
//
.Cost centers
[cols="1,2,4,1",options="header"]
|===
| Code | Name | What belongs here | Owner
| FIN | Finance | accountants and banking fees | Maťa
| BEN | Benefits | team buildings  | Lívia
| HUN | Hungary | everything in Budapest and beyond | Csongor
|===

It's also easy to control horizontal align and total width of the table:

.Inventory
[cols="<2,^4,>1",options="header",width="50%"]
|===
| Name | Description | Value
| baloon | little red ballon | $1,400.32
| wine bottle | empty green bottle | $40.50
| toast | very old piece of toast | $1.40
|===

Or even controll styling on a per-column basis:

.Poetry
[cols="1h,2e,2v",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Review | Sample

// For tables with complex or very long content, putting each column on its own
// line is practical.
| Flowers
| Remarkable piece of art never seen before
|
O flowers, dear flowers,
you are like lovers,
o my dear flowers.

| Grass
| Best piece of poetry since flowers
|
O grass, dear grass,
you are like grass,
o my dear grass.
|===

=== Complex Tables

.Cell spanning columns and rows
|===

3+|Content in a single cell that spans columns 1, 2, and 3 |Column 4, row 1

|Column 1, row 2
2.3+|Content in a single cell that spans over rows and columns
|Column 4, row 2

.2+|Content in a single cell that spans rows 2 and 3
|Column 4, row 3

|Column 1, row 4
|Column 4, row 4
|===

== Variables
Asciidoctor makes it easy to define variables for later reuse.

:euro: €
:commandkey: &#8984;
:CTO: https://vacuumlabs.slack.com/team/tomaskulich[Tomáš^]
:hq-address: vacuumlabs s.r.o., Radlinského 10, 811 07 Bratislava
:hq-email: hello@vacuumlabs.com

If you want to win 1,000 {euro}, email us on {hq-email} or send us a snail mail
to {hq-address}. {CTO} will pick the winners.

To copy the above address on Macs, use kbd:[{commandkey} + C].

== Imports
Single document can easily get too long to navigate easily. To help manage that,
Asciidoctor supports breaking your document into bunch of smaller files you can
import.

See the example below:
include::src/import.adoc[]

After the import ends, you can continue exactly where you ended. Or import
another file. Or even the same file again:

include::src/import.adoc[]

That's it.
