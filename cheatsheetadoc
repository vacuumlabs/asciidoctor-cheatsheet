= Asciidoctor cheatsheet

Hello, here are examples of the most common structures used
in adoc. Feel free to copy them and use for your benefit.

= Basic formatting
Insert desired text between formatting characters.
This is how you write *bold*. *Whole bold sentence.* +
This is how you write _italics_. _Whole italics sentence._ +
This is how you write `monospace`. `Whole monospace sentence.` +
This is how you write #highlighted#. #Whole highlighted sentence.#

= Using links
Use whole link as EXAMPLE. https://google.com/[EXAMPLE].

= Titles

= Document Title (Level 0)

== Level 1 Section Title

=== Level 2 Section Title

==== Level 3 Section Title

===== Level 4 Section Title

====== Level 5 Section Title

== Another Level 1 Section Title

:sectnums!:

== Unnumbered Section
=== Unnumbered Section

:sectnums:

[[section-one]]
== Section One



[[name-of-reference]]
= References

[[paragraph-reference]] Put this before desired referenced place. You use reference this way <<section-one>> <<paragraph-reference, Text shown on this place>>


= Lists

. first itme of list
. second item of list
. third, multiline item

you see, this is broken, but it is okay, look at the example below

. multiline item
+
--
// use this if you want to have something independent included in the list works
//with all types(description, ordered, unordered), no need for pluses and almost
//unbreakable
indented, not broken

I can even have a sublist here:

. darling
. cheatsheet
. icecream

or an example
----

----

Those two dashes marked segment can be inserted to any list

.Separated block of contents
====
Title for:: something that is indented but does not have a bullet

Title for some::
* bullet
* pointed

Or just regular paragraph cam be used here.

Experiment and try to use another structures they should work here like they do
usually.
====

====
It is not necessary to have a red title above the example just omit the dot, works
also for the blocks mentioned below
====

====
This is an example
======
This is an example inside an example
======
====

.This has big title - cool, isn't it?
****
Use asterisks to create a block of different colour than example, title can be also
omitted here, see below

Title for:: something that is indented but does not have a bullet

Title for some::
* bullet
* pointed
* things

Or just regular paragraph cam be used here.

Experiment and try to use another structures they should work here like they do usually.
====
You can even put an example here
====

****
You can omit title and it will still work

.Ahother type of separated section
----
Cheange equation marks for dashes and enjoy different design with monospace font.

But this type of block can be used just for plain text, no lists or other elements
work here.
